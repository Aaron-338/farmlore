Ladybugs (Coccinellidae) are effective natural predators for aphids. They can consume up to 50-60 aphids per day.

Lacewings are voracious predators that feed on aphids. Both adults and larvae can consume large numbers of aphids.

Hoverflies lay their eggs near aphid colonies, and their larvae feed on the aphids.

Parasitic wasps lay their eggs inside aphids, and the larvae consume the aphids from the inside.

Predatory midges (Aphidoletes aphidimyza) specifically target aphids and can be very effective for aphid control.
