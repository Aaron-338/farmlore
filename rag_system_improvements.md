# RAG System Improvements

## Issue Identified
We identified that the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system was not correctly matching plant-specific information. Specifically, when users asked about aphids on tomato plants, the system was incorrectly returning information about aphids on cucumber plants.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The original search function (`search_pest_data`) was not properly considering plant context when matching queries to the knowledge base.
2. This led to incorrect matches based primarily on keyword overlap and general similarity.
3. The "Managing Aphids on Cucumber Plants" entry was being returned instead of "Aphid Control on Tomatoes" because it had a higher calculated similarity score.

## Solution Implemented
1. Created an improved search function (`search_pest_data_improved`) that:
   - Detects plant context from the query (tomato, cucumber, rose, etc.)
   - Applies a significant score bonus to entries that match the plant context
   - Ensures plant-specific information is prioritized over generic pest information

2. Fixed the RAG web connector to use the improved search function:
   - Created and deployed the improved standalone RAG module
   - Updated the imports in the web connector to use the improved functions

## Results
1. For "How do I control aphids on my tomato plants?":
   - Before: Returned information about aphids on cucumber plants
   - After: Correctly returns information about aphids on tomatoes

2. For "What pests affect tomato plants?":
   - Before: Correctly returned information about tomato hornworms
   - After: Still correctly returns information about tomato hornworms

3. For "How do I treat aphids on roses?":
   - Before: Returned information about aphids on cucumber plants
   - After: Still returns information about aphids on cucumber plants (expected, as we don't have rose-specific information)

## Verification
We verified the improvements through:
1. Direct testing of the search function in the container
2. Testing the RAG enhancement endpoint
3. Testing the full proxy API with the improved RAG system

The RAG system now correctly provides plant-specific information based on the user's query, enhancing the chatbot's responses with the most relevant agricultural information.
